# Smart-Investments


## **Overview**
This application is designed to assist users in planning their investments well, as it provides them with accurate predictions of the price range of various major investments such as houses and gold. The house price predictions are also beneficial for property investors to know the trend of housing prices in certain locations. Gold price prediction offers insights into gold price fluctuations, behavior, and dynamics, ultimately providing the opportunity of gaining significant profits.

To achieve this, I employed various Machine Learning Models such as Random Forest, Decision Tree, KNN, Naive Bayesian, and Logistic Regression to predict the price of gold and house and find out which algorithm gives better accuracy. I then deployed the machine learning model that gives the best accuracy using Flask and integrated it with a web application. I developed the user interface of the application using Flask, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript and included user authentication for security purposes.

## **Results**
Developed a predictive model using Technical Analysis that accurately forecasted future prices of gold and houses in Boston with 79.87% and 82.34% accuracy, respectively, for the next 10 days from the present date. Identified trends and patterns in the price fluctuations of land and gold, leading to a predictive Machine Learning model that stays up-to-date and increases efficiency by 25%. Devised a user-friendly web application with three webpages and user authentication, allowing users to view the predicted prices of gold and houses in Boston and make informed investment decisions.

## **Technologies Used** Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, JavaScript, Flask, Ridge Regression Classifier, Random Forest Regression.
