## **Abstract**

Investments are an important part of saving one's money, smarter investments lead to better lives. Hence one needs to know the prices of their interested assets so as to make a better decision. The Idea is to provide a one stop solution where a user can predict prices of various major investments such as House and Gold. Here the aim is to make evaluations based on every basic parameter that is considered while determining the price. Various Machine Learning Models are used such as Random Forest, Decision Tree, KNN, Naive Bayesian, Logistic Regression will be used for predicting the Price of Gold and House to find out which algorithm gives better accuracy. The machine learning model which gives best accuracy is deployed using Flask and integrated with a web application and the user interface is built using Flask, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and JavaScript. This application is expected to help the user who plans to buy gold or house so they can know the price range in future, then they can plan their investments well. House price predictions are also beneficial for property investors to know the trend of housing prices in certain locations. Gold price prediction helps offer insights in gold price fluctuations, behavior and dynamics and ultimately provide the opportunity of gaining significant profits.
